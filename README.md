# dotfiles
THE configs of all time.

These are scattered dotfiles from my time on about 94 different distros.
Don't expect any of this crap to work well or even at all for you!
Theres even a bunch of stuff in here that specifically references my hardware.

### Map of the Chaos

- **install.sh** - Very self explanatory, installs the dotfiles. Don't run this
if you don't absolutely know what you're doing and have a backup of your stuff!

- **.config** - The .config stuff..

- **Applications** - Configs for bespoke applications that don't get installed
elsewhere for various reasons. (Things like my SV config are here.)

- **etc** - My `/etc` configs. DEFINITELY don't expect this stuff to just work.

- **.local/bin** - Abominations of scripting.

- **.wezterm.lua** - wezterm

- **.bashrc** bash

- **.bashrc.includes/** bash but extras

Good luck.
